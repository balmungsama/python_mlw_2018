    "__Overview:__\n",
    "- __[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html):__ Pandas is a Python package that provides fast and flexible data structures that are designed to make working with [relational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database) or \"labeled\" data easy and intuitive\n",
    "- In the words of [Wes McKinney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_McKinney), who created Pandas in 2008, and published [this](http://www.dlr.de/sc/Portaldata/15/Resources/dokumente/pyhpc2011/submissions/pyhpc2011_submission_9.pdf) paper in 2011 at PyHPC describing the usefulness and need for Pandas (which was a play on [__Pan__ el __Da__ ta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel_data) )\n",
    "\n",
    "_\"Pandas enables people to analyze and work with data who are not expert computer scientists...the code is intuitive and accessible. Pandas helps people move beyond just using Excel for data analysis\"_ \n",
    "\n",
    "- When Python was first developed, it was very difficult to perform tasks such as importing CSV files, dealing with spreadsheet-like datasets with rows and columns and merging tables \n",
    "- Therefore, Pandas was developed to solve these problems by introducing the `DataFrame` object, which made it possible to do intuitive analysis and exploration in Python that was not possible (and still not possible) in other programming languages (like Java, for example).\n",
    "- In recent years, the Pandas Package has become a staple in the Data Scientist's toolbox for some of the following reasons. In fact, Python is one of the most popular programming languages for Data Scientists specifically because of packages such as Pandas and Matplotlib.\n",
    "> 1. As a Data Scientist, it is common to work with tabular data where the data in each column is different, known as __hetereogenously-typed data__ (similar to a SQL table or Excel spreadsheet). Pandas `DataFrame` class replicates tabular data and allows you to do everything you would in a spreadsheet, but better and faster. \n",
    "> 2. The most time-consuming part of any Data Scientist's job is __[Data Munging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling)__ (Data Cleaning/Wrangling) and Pandas provides all the necessary tools at your fingertips to do this quicker and cleaner. \n",
    "> 3. Exploratory Data Analysis is often overlooked in Data Science, but remains one of the most important tasks of a Data Scientist and Pandas provides many easy and intuitive methods to perform data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now you understand why Data Scientists use the Pandas Package, but what is it about the Pandas Package that allows us to realize these benefits? \n",
    "> 1. __Missing Data:__ Pandas handles missing data well (represented as `NaN` a NumPy-defined missing value type)\n",
    "> 2. __Size Mutability:__ Pandas DataFrames are size mutable which means columns and rows can be inserted and deleted at will.\n",
    "> 3. __Data Aligment:__ Pandas allows you to align an object to a specific set of labels OR allow Pandas align the data for you.\n",
    "> 4. __Grouping Data:__ Pandas `groupby` function allows both aggregating and transforming of data.\n",
    "> 5. __Data Access:__ Pandas has extensive capabilities for slicing, indexing and subsetting large data sets.\n",
    "> 6. __Reshaping Data:__ Pandas has extensive capabilities for merging, joining, and reshaping data. \n",
    "> 7. __Input/Output:__ Pandas allows easy import and export of flat files such as CSV, json, etc."

    "- Recall that the usefulness of Pandas has to do with its fundamental data structures\n",
    "- There are 2 types of data structures in Pandas:\n",
    "> 1. [`Series`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.Series.html#pandas.Series): Series is a one-dimensional labeled array that is capable of holding any data type (i.e. `int`, `str`, `float`, etc.), but every element is of this same type. The axis labels of a Series are referred to as the __Index__ of the Series\n",
    ">> - The `pd.Series(data, index)` function which creates a Series data structure, has 2 arguments:<br>\n",
    ">> a. `index`: The `index` argument is a list of axis labels<br>\n",
    ">> b. `data`: The `data` argument can be any of the following:\n",
    ">> > 1. Python dictionary (`dict`)\n",
    ">> > 2. NumPy Array (`ndarray`)\n",
    ">> > 3. Scalar value (5)<br> \n",
    "> 2. [`DataFrame`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html): Dataframe is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It largely resembles a spreadsheet or SQL table. The first axis labels of a Dataframe (rows) are referred to as the __Index__ of the Series, whereas the second axis labels labels of a Dataframe (columns) are referred to as the __Columns__ of the Series\n",
    ">> - The `pd.DataFrame(data, index, columns)` function which creates a Dataframe data structure, has 3 arguments:<br>\n",
    ">> a. `index`: The `index` argument is a list of axis 0 labels<br>\n",
    ">> b. `columns`: The `column` argument is a list of axis 1 labels<br>\n",
    ">> c. `data`: The `data` argument can be any of the following:\n",
    ">> > 1. Dictionary of 1D ndarrays, lists, dicts, or Series \n",
    ">> > 2. 2-D NumPy Array (`ndarray` object) \n",
    ">> > 3. A `Series` object \n",
    ">> > 4. Another `DataFrame` object\n",
    ">> > 5. List of Python dictionaries \n",
    ">> > 6. From CSV or Excel file (or any of the possible file formats which can be found [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/io.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Helpful Points:__\n",
    "1. Remember that data alignment in Pandas is intrinsic which means that the link between labels and data will not be broken unless you do so explicitly \n",
    "2. If you pass an index and/or columns into the function, you guarantee these in the resulting object. Therefore, if you also pass a dictionary, for example, you will lose all the data from the dictionary that does not match the passed-in index.\n",
    "3. If axis labels are not passed into the function, they will be constructed from the input data.\n",
    "4. We will see examples of creating both types of data structures below.\n",

    "- Pandas offers many ways to \"inspect\" tabular data. \n",
    "- The following are useful ways of inspecting Pandas Data Structures where `obj` is either a `Series` or a `DataFrame`.\n",
    "> 1. __Dimensions:__ Dimensions can be accessed using `len(obj)`, `obj.shape`, and `obj.size`\n",
    "> 2. __Row Labels:__ Row labels can be accessed using `obj.index`, `obj.index.name`\n",
    "> 3. __Column Labels:__ (Only for DataFrames) Column labels can be accessed using `obj.columns`, `obj.columns.values`, `obj.columns.values.tolist()`, `obj.columns.tolist()`\n",
    "> 4. __Name Labels:__ (Only for Series, unless accessing specific columns) Name labels can be accessed using `obj.name`\n",
    "> 5. __Data Values:__ Data values can be accessed using `obj.values` \n",
    "> 6. __Data Type:__ Data types can be accessed using `obj.dtypes`\n",
    "> 7. __Data Quick Look:__  Data quick looks can be accessed using `obj.head(n)`, `obj.tail(n)`\n",
    "> 8. __Data Summary:__ Data summary can be completed by `obj.describe`\n",
    "\n",
    "__Helpful Points:__\n",
    "1. It is possible to inspect both Series and DataFrames, however DataFrames have some additional functions for inspection given that they have an additional dimension and attributes.\n",
    "2. Pandas Series and DataFrames will be explored separately below\n",

    "### Indexing Pandas Data Structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Overview:__ \n",
    "- Pandas offers many different techniques to index (access) elements within Data Structures which can be found [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html)\n",
    "- There are 6 main ways of indexing Pandas data structures:\n",
    "> 1. __Select by Column Name:__ The syntax of this method is `df[col_name]` and it returns a `Series` object\n",
    "> 2. __[Select by Label](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#indexing-label):__ This describes __purely label-based indexing__ which selects labels based on what is included in the index of the object. The syntax of this method (for DataFrames) is `df.loc[row_label, column_label]` and it returns a `Series` object. The following provides a list of the possible arguments for the `row_label` and/or `column_label`:\n",
    ">> a. A single label (i.e. `5` or `a`, but the number `5` is interpreted as the label and NOT as the index (use `.iloc` for this)<br>\n",
    ">> b. A list or array of labels (i.e. `['a', 'b', 'c']`<br>\n",
    ">> c. A slice object with labels (i.e. `['a':'f']`, but unlike with other slices in Python, the `stop` argument is included in the slide  \n",
    ">> d. A boolean array \n",
    "> 3. __[Select by Integer Location (Position)](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#indexing-integer):__ This describes __purely integer-based indexing__ which requires an integer (0-based indexing) for input. The syntax of this method is (for DataFrames) `df.iloc[row_number, column_number]` and it returns a `Series` object. The following provides a list of the possible arguments for `row_number` and/or `column_number`:\n",
    ">> a. An integer (i.e. `5`)<br>\n",
    ">> b. A list or array of integers (i.e. `[4, 3, 0]`<br>\n",
    ">> c. A slice object with integers (i.e. `[1:7]`<br>\n",
    ">> d. A boolean array \n",
    "> 4. __[Slicing Ranges](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#slicing-ranges):__ The syntax of this method is (for DataFrames) `df[row_number_1:row_number_2]` and it returns a `DataFrame` object. The `[` and `]` operator is responsible for the slicing and this ONLY operates on rows\n",
    "> 5. __[Boolean Indexing](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#boolean-indexing):__ The syntax of this method is (for DataFrames) `df[boolean_vector]` and it returns a `DataFrame` object. This is performed using boolean operators such as `|` for `or`, `&` for `and` and `~` for not and each must be grouped by parantheseses\n",
    "> 6. __[Indexing with isin](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html#indexing-with-isin):__ The syntax of this method is (for DataFrames) `df.isin(values)` and it returns a boolean vector that is true wherever the Series elements exist in the passed list \n",
    "\n",
    "__Helpful Points:__\n",
    "1. Both Series and DataFrames can be indexed, naturally though, Series have less functionality\n",

    "### Advanced Manipulation in Pandas - Introduction to GroupBy:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Overview:__\n",
    "- The GroupBy functionality draws from the common \"Split-Apply-Combine\" strategy which is summarized below:\n",
    "> 1. __Split:__  The split step involves splitting the data into groups based on some criteria\n",
    "> 2. __Apply:__ The apply step involves applying a function to each group independently. The functions applied in this step fall in 3 main categories:\n",
    ">> a. __Aggregation:__ The aggregation functions compute a summary statistic about each group (i.e. group sums, means, sizes, counts, etc.)<br>\n",
    ">> b. __Transformation:__ The transformation functions perform some group-specific computations on each group (i.e. standardize data within each group, fill NAs within groups, etc.)<br>\n",
    ">> c. __Filtration:__ The filtration functions discard some groups according to a group-wise computation (i.e. discard data that belongs to groups with only a few members, filter out data based on group sum or mean, etc.)<br>\n",
    "> 3. __Combine:__ The combine step involves combining the results into a data structure \n",
    "\n",
    "__Helpful Points:__\n",
    "1. The GroupBy functionality exists in the SQL command `GROUP BY` which you can read about [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/group-by-modifiers.html) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/select-group-by-transact-sql) if you are interested \n",
    "2. Arguably the most common functionality for Data Scientists is \"GroupBy-Aggregation\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### GroupBy in Pandas:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Overview:__\n",
    "- The __[GroupBy](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/groupby.html)__ function in Pandas allows us to perform the \"split-apply-combine\" strategy in a very efficient manner\n",
    "- The procedure is performed in the following steps where the \"combine\" step is implicit in the \"apply\" step:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. __STEP 1 (SPLIT):__ Splitting is completed by creating a \"GroupBy\" object which basically just means separating out the data into constituent groups. GroupBy objects can be created in the following way: \n",
    ">> a. `grouped = obj.groupby(key)`<br>\n",
    ">> b. `grouped = obj.groupby(key, axis=1)`<br>\n",
    ">> c. `grouped = obj.groupby([key1, key2])`\n",
    ">> - Here, the `obj` is usually a Pandas `DataFrame` object and the `key` is most commonly one of the following:<br>\n",
    ">> > a. List or NumPy array<br> \n",
    ">> > b. Dictionary or Series<br>\n",
    ">> > c. Column name<br>\n",
    ">> - In practice, the \"group keys\" will refer to the labels of each group (i.e. \"A\" and \"B\" are the group keys for Group \"A\" and Group \"B\" and \"Group\" would be passed as the `key` argument into the `groupby` function) \n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. __STEP 2 (APPLY):__ Now that a GroupBy object has been created, we can perform various \"apply\" methods to the object such as:\n",
    ">> a. __Aggregation:__ Aggregation returns a new DataFrame and can be completed in this fashion: `grouped.agg` or `grouped.aggregate`<br>\n",
    ">> b. __Transformation:__ Transformation returns an object that is indexed the same as the one begin grouped and can be completed in this fashion: `grouped.transform`<br>\n",
    ">> c. __Filtration:__ Filtration returns a subset of the original object and can be completed in this fashion: `grouped.filter`<br>\n",
    ">> d. __Other:__ `grouped.count`, `grouped.cummax`, `grouped.cumsum`, `grouped.fillna`, `grouped.max`, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Helpful Points:__\n",
    "1. GroupBy objects have a few useful attributes for analyzing the groups that were created:\n",
    "> 1. The `groups` attribute to view the groups that were created: `df.groupby(key).groups`\n",
    "> 2. The `describe` attribute to view information about the groups that were created: `df.groupby(key).describe()`\n",
    "> 3. The `ngroups` attribute to view the number of groups that were created: `df.groupby(key).ngroups`\n",
    "> 4. The `first` attribute to view the first few rows of the groups that were created: `df.groupby(key).first()`\n",
    "> 5. The `last` attribute to view the last few rows of the groups that were created: `df.groupby(key).last()`\n",
    "> 6. The `get_group` attribute to access one of the many groups that were created:`df.groupby(key).get_group()`\n",
    "2. Remember you can always see a complete list of all the attributes of an object by selecting `obj.<TAB>`\n",

    "\n",
    "__Overview:__\n",
    "- Merging, Joining, and Conatenating using Pandas Dataframes are very useful, however, advanced for the beginner programmer\n",
    "- However, the does not mean we can't explore the basics of what merging, joining, and concatenating is and how we can do it in Pandas \n",
    "- The full documentation for Merge, Join, and Concatenate can be found [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/merging.html)\n",
    "- All 3 methods below, in their own way, describe the act of combining together Series and DataFrame objects with some logic to handle the indexes of the objects you are combining:\n",
    "> 1. __Concatenating Objects:__ Concatenating objects in Pandas is done using the `concat` or the `append` function and you can think of this as \"gluing together\" multiple DataFrames or Series \n",
    "> 2. __Merging Objects:__ Merging objects in Pandas is done using the `merge` function and replicates [SQL Joins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL))\n",
    "> 3. __Joining Objects:__ Joining objects in Pandas is done using the `join` function and can be used for combining the columns of two potentially differently-indexed DataFrames into a single result DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "__Helpful Points:__\n",
    "1. We actually have already concatenated DataFrames above when we added a new row to an existing DataFrame \n",
    "2. Remember that indexes are very important to DataFrames and most of the \"logic\" that these methods employ revolve around what to do with DataFrames/Series that have different indexes\n",
    "3. SQL and Databases is definitely not required knowledge for this course, but further reading on Data Models (for your interest only) can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_(data_model)) for __One-to-One Relationships__ and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-to-many_(data_model)) for __Many-to-Many Relationships__\n",

    "### Handling Missing Values:\n",
    "__Overview:__\n",
    "- In Data Science, when working with real-world data, it is very common to encounter missing data that may be a result of data not available, data not recorded, or data not present for some other reason.\n",
    "- You should be aware of the possibile options that Pandas provides for storing missing data, finding missing data, inserting missing data, and cleaning/filling missing data which can be read about in detail [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/missing_data.html) and explained below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. __Storing Missing Data:__ The value `NaN` is the default missing value marker, but sometimes `None` is used as well \n",
    "> 2. __Finding Missing Data:__ Pandas offers many convenient functions for testing if values are missing such as: `df.isna()`, `df.notna()`, `df.isnull()`, `df.notnull()` which all return a boolean same-sized object indicating if the values are missing. It is also possible to use these functions to count the number of missing values (i.e. `np.count_nonzero(df.isnull())`, `np.count_nonzero(np.any(df.isnull(), axis=)`)\n",
    "> 3. __Cleaning/Filling Missing Data:__ Pandas offers many convenient functions for filling missing values such as: `df.fillna(value)` and `df.dropna(axis)`\n",
    "\n",
    "__Helpful Points:__\n",
    "1. Note two `NaN` values do not compare (i.e. `np.nan == np.nan` is evaluated as `False`)\n",
